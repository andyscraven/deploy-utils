# DeployUtils

A very opinionated set of utilities to deploy and upgrade my Hardhat projects. You are welcome to use it, but it's not meant to be a general purpose tool.


## History

**1.0.0-beta.8**
- if `constructorTypes` not an array, it assumes the third parameter is the salt

**1.0.0-beta.7**
- `deployContractViaNickSFactory` returns now the contract, instead of the address
